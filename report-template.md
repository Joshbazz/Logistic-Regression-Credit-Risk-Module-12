## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
- To create and evaluate machine learning models with imbalanced and balanced datasets to predict whether a loan is classified correctly as healthy or high-risk
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
- historical lending activity
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
- the target variable, loan status. In the original dataset, this was highly imbalanced. 
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
- prep the data, split the data, train on imbalanced data, eval original data model
- repeat process but balance the data first
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).
- LogisticRegression class and RandomOverSampler were used

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
